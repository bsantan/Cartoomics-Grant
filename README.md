# Cartoomics Figure Generation 

This Cartoomics repository consists of a workflow written in python that can generate an interaction network using a given knowledge graph from a user derived description of a cartoon image. The goal of this workflow is to generate complete and detailed pathway diagrams using the vast information contained within a knowledge graph.

## Getting Started

These instructions will provide the necessary environments, programs with installation instructions, and input files in order to run the creating_subgraph_from_KG.py script, which will run this workflow from end to end. 

The path search algorithms available are:

- Shortest Path Search: find the shortest path between each source and target node. A random path is chosen from paths of identical length, regardless if graph is weighted or unweighted. Thus, shortest path may not be identical each time. 
- Cosine similarity Prioritization: prioritize all shortest paths between each source and target node by maximizing total cosine similarity of the start and all intermediate nodes to the target node in each path
- Path Degree Product Prioritization: prioritize all shortest paths between each source and target node by maximizing path degree product of all nodes in each path

The program will output a subgraph generated using the Cosine Similarity, Path-Degree Product, and Edge Exclusion algorithms.

### Dependencies
The following dependencies are listed in the environment.yml file, and installed in the installation step. This software has only been tested on Unix based OS systems, not Windows.
```
Python>=3.8.3
tqdm>=4.64.0
gensim>=4.2.0
numpy>=1.22.4
scipy>=1.8.1
py4cytoscape>=1.3.0
csrgraph>=0.1.28
nodevectors>=0.1.23
igraph>=0.9.10
```

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/bsantan/Cartoomics-Grant
```

First install mamba, which will be used to create the environment. To create an environment with all dependencies and activate the environment, run the following commands:

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
conda activate Cartoomics
```

Ensure that Cytoscape (any version later than 3.8.0) is up and running before continuing.

## Running the Script

### Input Directory

The following files must exist in the input directory:

<img width="994" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-25 at 9 37 40 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70932395/186709025-6eb4495d-6c12-4353-a1af-5626d835e4ea.png">

To access the v3 PheKnowLator knowledge graph, visit the GCS bucket: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/pheknowlator/current_build/knowledge_graphs/instance_builds/relations_only/owlnets?pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22))&project=pheknowlator&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false

Add the necessary files for the knowledge graph (Triples file and Labels file) to a directory that also contains all files in the Input_Files folder of this repository, and specify this as your input directory.

### Defaults
  
The following values will be used if not otherwise specified:
- embedding dimensions: embeddings of the knowledge graph will be generated using node2vec of dimension 128, unless otherwise specified
  --embedding-dimensions <int>
- weights: edges will not be weighted unless otherwise specified. Any edges specified (where edge_1/edge_2 are labels from the input labels file) will be weighted lower/more important in the path search. 
  --weights "[edge_1, edge_2]"
- search type: the shortest path algorithm used (contained within the python-igraph package) will search for paths in all directions, unless otherwise specified
  --search-type one

### Command Line Argument: subgraph generation 
  
To run the script, execute the following command once the input directory is prepared:
  
```
python creating_subgraph_from_KG.py --input-dir INPUTDIR --output-dir OUTPUTDIR --knowledge-graph pkl
```

**Note that the output-dir should be in quotes**
 
  
### Command Line Argument: evaluation files
  
To run the evaluation script, execute the following command once the subgraph generation script is run:
  
```
python evaluate_all_subgraphs.py --input-dir INPUTDIR --output-dir OUTPUTDIR --knowledge-graph pkl
```

**Note that the output-dir should be in quotes, and all subgraph files (described below) must be generated**
 

## Expected Outputs
  
### Subgraph Files
  
The creating_subgraph_from_KG.py script will always generate the following files:
  
### Subgraph
  
A .csv file which shows all source and target nodes found in the path search that include the original example cartoon (Input file above) and any intermediate nodes found in the path search.

```
S|P|O
insulin receptor (human)|subClassOf|insulin receptor
insulin receptor (human)|participates_in|Insulin receptor signalling cascade
```
  
### Subgraph Attributes

A .noa file which specifies which input nodes are from the original example cartoon (Input file above) and which were intermediate nodes found in the path search. 
  
```
Node|Attribute
insulin receptor (human)|Extra
insulin receptor|Mechanism
```

### Subgraph Visualization
  
A .png file generated in cytoscape with all nodes found in the path search, colored by original nodes and intermediate nodes.

The creating_subgraph_using_cosinesim.py script will also generate the following intermediate files:
  
### Files generated for embeddings:
 
- PheKnowLator_v3.0.2_full_instance_relationsOnly_OWLNETS_Triples_Integer_Identifier_Map
- PheKnowLator_v3.0.2_full_instance_relationsOnly_OWLNETS_Triples_Integers_node2vecInput
- PheKnowLator_v3.0.2_full_instance_relationsOnly_OWLNETS_Triples_node2vecInput_cleaned
- PheKnowLator_v3_node2vec_Embeddings<DIM>.emb (where <DIM> is the # dimensions specified)
  
*Note if the above files already exist in the output directory when running the script, the embeddings will not be re-generated.*

### Evaluation Files 
  
The evaluate_all_subgraphs.py script will always generate the following files:

### Number of Nodes Comparison
  
A .csv file with the number of nodes in each subgraph generated by algorithm (cs: Cosine Similarity, pdp: Path-Degree Product, and/or either with Edge Exclusion- ee_cs or ee_pdp).
  
```
cs,pdp
17,18
```
  
### Path Length Comparison
  
A .csv file with the path length of each pair that exists in each subgraph generated by algorithm (cs: Cosine Similarity, pdp: Path-Degree Product, and/or either with Edge Exclusion- ee_cs or ee_pdp).
  
```
cs,pdp
3,3
3,3
```
  
### Intermediate Nodes Comparison
  
A .csv file with the number of intermediate nodes between each specified pair that belong to ontologies (normalized). Defined for each subgraph generated by algorithm (cs: Cosine Similarity, pdp: Path-Degree Product, and/or either with Edge Exclusion- ee_cs or ee_pdp).
  
```

A .csv file with the resulting calculation from each algorithm for each path from all-shortest paths. This value is used to rank each path and prioritize in the ranked_comparison.csv.
  
```
